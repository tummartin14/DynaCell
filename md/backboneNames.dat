;List of known peptide-residues and their backbone-atoms
;This will tell dynacell which residues should be considered peptidic
;so that constituting atoms can be separated into backbone and sidechain
;All PDB atom-names not listed under a certain residue will be considered sidechain
;All residues not listed here will be considered non-peptide
;Format:
;"list of residue names" : "list of PDB-atom-names considered to be backbone"
;Note that the PDB-atom-name-list can be empty (all atoms considered sidechain
;for that residue), while the residue-list cannot
